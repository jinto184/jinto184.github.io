African Club Moss ,Selaginella kraussiana,"Small, carpet-forming, fern ally groundcover with long, fine roots and creeping, slender, irregularly branched stems that root at nodes. Leaves (2-4mm) are in rows. Spore cones (10mm long) are rounded. ","Spores and stem fragments are spread on boots, by livestock, water movement and dumped vegetation and in contaminated soil. Tracks, streams, contaminated plants and potting mix in nurseries and shops, and gardens are all sources of new infestations.",Spray: glyphosate (20ml/L). Follow up as above. 
African Feather Grass,Cenchrus macrourus,"Perennial, clump-forming grass (<2 m) with deep fibrous roots and rhizomes (7 mm diameter and <2 m long) that form new plants. Tough, harsh, strongly ribbed leaves (13 mm x 1.2 m) are light green on top and darker green underneath. Round erect purplish-white stems (up to 2m tall) have many fine hairs that break off when touched, causing skin irritations. Narrow, cylindrical, spike-like flowerheads (10-30cm long, 10-20mm diameter) contain many seeds, each with bristles (10 mm).","Rhizomes creep outwards and fragments are spread by soil movement and machinery. Seeds are spread via water and by wind for short distances, and also in clothing, animals, pelts.",Slash and spray regrowth (spring-autumn): Gallant (150ml/10L).
African Lovegrass,Eragrostis curvula,"Variable, densely tufted, tussock-like, erect or prostrate perennial grass (1-1.5 m tall) that is deciduous in cold areas. Fibrous roots (<50cm deep), and narrow, hair-like leaves (3-7mm wide) are rolled inwards, rough, bright green to bluegreen (blushes bronze-red after hard frost), and usually curly at tips. Seedheads with blackish, olive purplish seeds (ripening to greyish) in summer are usually loose, airy hanging clusters (6-30 x 4-20cm), on arching stems (<1 m long). Several varieties occur in New Zealand, and harshness and palatability to animals varies widely.","Seeds are spread in wind, and on vehicles, stock and people. Reseeds prolifically after fire, spraying or mechanical disturbance.",Spray (spring-summer): glyphosate (15ml/L) + penetrant (non-selective) or Gallant (150ml/10L) (selective).
African Olive ,Olea europeaea subspecies cuspidata,"Dense bushy shrub or small tree to 7 m tall with angular, scaly young stems and bark that becomes rough as it matures. Lance-shaped leaves (5-11 x 1-2 cm) are in opposite pairs on the stem, and are dark green and occasionally scaly above, and scaly and pale green or silvery underneath. Whitish, strongly smelling flowers (3-4 mm long) appear from July to March, followed by an ovalish glossy fruit (5-8 mm diameter) that ripens from green to red to black. ","Birds, possibly possums and livestock eat the fruit and spread the seeds. Common sources are gardens, hedges and waste places. ",
Balloon Vine,Cardiospermum grandiflorum,"Perennial climber with yellow hairs on a ribbed stem, and compound leaves of 9 thin, coarsely toothed, light green, hairy leaflets (2.5-10 cm long) arranged in groups of 3. Clusters of white to pale yellow flowers with 4 petals (7-9mm long) are produced from summer to winter, with tendrils growing from the base of the flower stalk. Balloon-like fruit has 3 thin, papery walls (4-8cm long), ripens from green to straw coloured in autumn and contains 3 black seeds (7mm wide).","Seed capsules are spread by wind and water, and spreads also by suckering and root fragments.",
Californian Poppy,Eschscholzia californica,"E. californica can be distinguished from other poppies by its leaves which are divided into linear segments, its watery sap, and its seed capsule that splits into two parts.",Outcompetes small native grasses and herbs on poor soils.,
Dally Pine,Psoralea pinnata,"Often mistaken for young pine trees.
Alternatives: Try the native koromiko (Hebe salicifolia) or kawakawa (Macropiper excelsum), or the non-native correa species or fuchsia hybrids. Your local garden centre will be able to recommend other non-weedy alternatives that will grow well in your area.","Dominates low canopy habitats, delaying (occasionally preventing) the establishment of native plant seedlings. Increased nitrogen in gumlands and other impoverished soil types may change the species that are present and resulting change in habitat may be to the detriment of specialised plants eg. orchids, ferns, herbs, etc, or encourage further weed invasions. Can replace manuka in successional process. ",
Egeria ,Egeria densa,"Submerged, bottom-rooting perennial, growing to 5 m. Slender, brittle, buoyant stems (3 mm diameter) are much-branched. Linear, dark green leaves (15-30 x 4 mm) are in whorls of 4-6 (occasionally 3 near base). From November to January it produces flowers (20 mm diameter) that are white, 3-petalled with yellow stamens, and that sit on the surface of the water. As only male plants are found in New Zealand, no seed is set. ","Loose stem fragments root at any node, colonising new sites. Water flow spreads it within catchments, and new catchments are infested by fragments spread by boats and trailers (occasionally motor cooling water), eel nets, diggers, people liberating fish, and floods from ornamental ponds. Birdspread is not a factor. ",
Fairy Crassula,Crassula multicava,"Creeping succulent herb with fleshy leaves (4 x 4 cm) covered with small, pitted dots. Clusters of small, pale pink flowers on upright stems appear in spring, and small plantlets develop in these clusters after flowering.","Competes with native species, forming dense mats.",
German Ivy ,Delairea odorata,"Despite its common name, this scrambling invader from the daisy family is actually from South Africa. It is from the same family as ragwort, and that shows in its ragwort-like yellow flowers that form fluffy seeds like its agricultural cousin. Scrambling or climbing perennial vine to 3-5 m with thin, weak green stems. Thin, soft, glossy, hairless leaves are ivy-shaped and clammy to touch. Dense clusters of yellow, ragwort-like flowers (7 mm diameter) are produced from May to October, followed by fluffy seeds. ","Seeds spread by wind and in dumped vegetation and soil movement. Common sources are gardens, waste places, roadsides and bush edges. ","Cut stems below waist height, spray below this point (spring-summer to actively growing plants): glyphosate (10ml/L knapsack) or (2L/100L spraygun) or metsulfuron-methyl 600g/kg (2g/10L knapsack) or (20g/100L spraygun) or Tordon Brushkiller (60ml/10L) or Banvine (12ml/L) or Yates Woody Weedkiller (24ml/L) or amitrole (150ml/15L knapsack) or (2L/100L spraygun). Add penetrant to all mixes."

Grooved, hollow stems (5-10 cm diameter) are blotched and spotted reddish purple, and have sturdy bristles containing a toxic sap. From December to February in its second year it produces a tall flower stalk with leaves attached and large umbrella-like clusters (20-60 cm diameter) of white flowers (1.5 cm diameter) that are followed by dry, flattened, oval, light brown fruit (1 cm long).","It is poisonous to humans - touching it, or exposure to dust from weed-eating, can irritate skin and cause blisters and swelling. Sap from leaves and stems is highly toxic and can cause 'photodermatitis' or 'photosensitivity' (the skin becomes very sensitive to sunlight and may suffer blistering, pigmentation and long-lasting scars). Contact with the eyes can lead to temporary or permanent blindness. Areas which come into contact with this plant should be washed immediately and protected from direct sunlight, seek medical advice.",
Hawkweed,Hieracium species,"Perennial herbs that form mats of tight, interconnected rosettes with thick underground root systems, and often with above-ground root systems (stolons) as well. Leaves (25-150 x 6-50 cm) are dull green to dark green above, usually paler (occasionally purplish) below, with those at the base of the plant usually slightly toothed, and with bristly hairs above and star-shaped hairs below. Thin stems (10-75 cm) have milky sap. Lemon or yellow dandelion-like flowers appear from October to May (orange, purple when dry, in H. aurantiacum and H. x stoloniflorum), which occasionally have red stripes on outer face. Seeds with fluffy, dirty-white hairs (4-8 mm) also appear from October to May.","Seed is spread by wind, and in clothing and animal pelts. Root fragments are spread by water movement, contaminated soil and machinery.",
Ice Plant,Carpobrotus edulis,"Low-growing, mat forming perennial with fleshy, succulent, 3-angled leaves (7-12 cm long) and 2-angled stems. Many-petalled yellow flowers (up to 10 cm diameter) that turn pinkish-orange with age and fleshy fruit containing seed are produced year-round, but are most common from October to February. Can hybridise with the native Disphyma australe to produce smaller plants (leaves 2-6cm long) with orange-pink or yellow-whitish flowers (4.5-6cm diameter), turning pink with a yellow base with age. No fruit is formed.",C. edulis spreads by seed and stem fragments. Hybrid plants do not form seeds but spread by stem fragments. The ability to root at each node (stem joint) allows it to spread rapidly.,
Japanese Honeysuckle ,Lonicera japonica,"Many similar Lonicera species are cultivated, and hybrids and cultivars of L. japonica. L. pericyclamineum and L. x americana are both found in the wild. ","Climbs over and smothers most plants from ground to medium canopy. Can cause canopy collapse and subsequent invasion of grasses or ground vines. Provides support for faster growing weedy vines (eg morning glory, moth plant). ",
Kangaroo Acacia ,Acacia paradoxa,"Shrub or small tree (<3 m tall) with furrowed twigs that are moderately hairy.  Leaves (10-18 x 2-8 mm) reduced to small, oval, asymmetric flaps on stem and thin stiff spines at base. Clusters of 5+ small, golden, pea-sized flowers appear from Jul-Oct and are followed by hairy, straight or curved seed pods (40-50 x 3-4 mm). ","Seeds are spread by soil, and occasionally water, movement, from waste places, old hedges, roadsides, quarries. ",Overall spray (spring-summer): triclopyr 600g/L (60ml/10L)+ penetrant.
Khasia Berry ,Cotoneaster simonsii,"C. glaucophyllus, C. franchetii, and C. divaricatus are similar. ","Forms understorey in open forest and invades margins. Overtops and replaces shrub species, and prevents the establishment of native plant seedlings.",
Lantana ,Lantana camara var. aculeata,"Smelly scrambling evergreen shrub to 4-5 m with woody taproot with laterals that sucker when broken. Young stems are 4-angled, hairy and prickly, and older stems are rounded, woody, much branched, and brittle. Hairy, ovalish leaves (3-9 cm long) in opposite pairs along the stems, very wrinkled, and have toothed edges. Conspicuous flat flower heads (2-3 cm across) with many tiny tubular flowers, each cream, yellow, orange, pink, red, purple or mixtures of these, changing colour as they mature, are present all year round. Small, clustered, berry-like fruits, green ripening to juicy purple-black, contain one small pale seed per fruit. ","Seeds are spread by birds, and suckering roots allow thickets to remain dense. Roots and seeds are spread in contaminated soil, dumped vegetation, and common sources are gardens, roadsides, and waste areas. ",
Manchurian Rice Grass ,Zizania latifolia,"Dense, mat-forming perennial to 2-3 m with rhizomes (2-3cm diameter) up to 5 m long and fibrous roots. Harsh, papery, dull grey-green leaves (2-3 cm wide) are straight, up to 2.5 m long, have a stout midrib, taper to a point, and rustle loudly in the wind. From November to December a purplish or red-brown flowerhead (40-60 cm long) is produced.","Rhizomes spread outwards slowly, but more rapid spread comes from seeds and rhizome fragments being moved by water, livestock, machinery, clothing, and possibly by birds. Road graders, soil movement, dumped vegetation, contaminated diggers, farm machinery, eel nets, boats and trailers all spread seed and rhizome fragments into new catchments, lowland pasture, roadsides, water tables, drains and farm dams. ",
Nardoo,Marsilea mutica,"Floating aquatic fern with four-lobed frond that looks like a four-leaved clover (up to 6 cm diameter), floating flat on the water surface or held up on leaf stalks from damp ground; stalks can grow to 1 m long when submerged. Fronds may have red-purple markings which divide the lobes into inner and outer zones of green or a simple two-tone green pattern. Takes root in the soil but mature plants can detach from the soil and form large free-floating 'rafts'","Spreads by rhizomes, and by wind and water movement of free-floating 'rafts' of vegetation.",
Old Man’s Beard ,Clematis vitalba,"Deciduous, climbing, layering vine to 20 m tall with very long, woody stems with six prominent ribs (appear as furrows in older vines) and pale, easily rubbed-off bark. Leaves are arranged in opposite pairs on the stems, and are made up of five (rarely three) widely spaced leaflets that fall in autumn. Thin, papery leaftlets are sparsely hairy and have bluntly toothed or smooth edges. Creamy white, fragrant flowers (2-3 cm diameter) produced from December to May, followed by grey, hairy seeds (2-3 mm long) with distinctive white plumes (3-4 cm long) in dense, fluffy clusters persisting over winter (hence the 'old man's beard').
Native clematis usually has 3 leaflets per stem, smooth stems, and is evergreen.","Seed is spread by water or wind, and both seed and stem fragments are spread in dumped vegetation. Common sources are forests, roadsides, hedgerows, vacant land, and willow swamps.",
Palm Grass ,Setaria palmifolia,"Dense, palm-like grass with a dense root mass and tough rhizomes with rounded stems. Harsh, hanging palm-like leaves (30-100 x 5-8 cm) are pleated and taper to a point.

Slower spead occurs from gardens and through dumped garden waste. ",
Queen Of The Night ,Cestrum nocturnum,"Smelly shrub 1.5-2.5 m tall with erect, hairless stems that become woody as the plant matures. Hairless, alternate leaves (5-15 x 1.5-6 cm) are foul-smelling when bruised. Large open clusters of strongly-scented pale green or greenish-white tubular flowers (15-20 mm long) with petal margins bent backwards and which only open at nightime appear from November to March, followed by clusters of glossy white berries (5-10 mm diameter).","Birds, flooding, soil movement, and vegetation dumping. Very common in gardens. ",
Ragwort ,Jacobaea vulgaris,"Smelly biennial or perennial (occasionally annual) herb to 30-120 cm tall, with a tap root (crown) with numerous fibrous roots extending 30+ cm. Wavy, lobed leaves (5-20 x 4-6 cm) emerge initially from a basal rosette, and stem leaves are deeply cut, clasp the stem, and have no broad terminal lobes. Erect, rigid stems (50-120 cm) are single (multiple in perennial plants), usually purplish and usually branch above the middle. Yellow, daisy-like flowers (up to 2 cm diameter) with golden yellow centres are produced from November to April and have 11-13 yellow petal-like florets in compact, flat-topped clusters at the ends of stems. Seeds are like thistledown. ","Wind spreads seeds over great distances, and they are also spread by water, soil movement, contaminated machinery, livestock, lime, clothing and hay. ","Grubbing or pulling ragwort is best done at full to late flowering stage, when the roots are less likely to regrow. Flower heads of pulled plants should be burned.
Damaged plants (from cutting, digging, pugging, mowing or poor spraying) usually regrow, form large additional root crowns (multicrown) and become perennial, ie. flowering annually and not dying. These plants do not respond to 2,4-D herbicide, requiring tougher, more residual herbicides. "
Red Cestrum ,,"Smelly shrub to 2-4 m with erect stems that are densely covered with purplish hairs when young and become woody as plant matures. Hairy leaves (40-150 x 15-75 mm) are foul-smelling when bruised and are arranged alternately on the stems. C. elegans has dense clusters of tubular magenta to deep crimson scentless flowers (15-25 mm long) with petal margins bent backwards from January to December, the flowers on C. fasciculatum are scarlet and appear from August to March. When produced, berries (7-15mm diameter) are crimson to dark red. ","Birds, flooding, soil movement and vegetation dumping all spread seeds. ",
Salvinia,Salvinia molesta,"Free-floating fern (<30cm) with two leaves above the water and one rootlike leaf below. Two leaf types: juvenile leaves well-spaced, small, lying on surface (occasionally only these leaves are produced), while more common rounded mature leaves (1-4 x 1-5cm) are crowded, compacted, folded about the midrib, and the upper surfaces have many rows of water-repellent, basket-like hairs.","Does not produce spores, spreads by fragmentation only through water movement, deliberate 'liberation' of aquarium contents into ponds or lakes.",
Taiwan Cherry,Prunus campanulata,"Small deciduous tree (< 8 m tall) with a short trunk and narrowly spreading branches (branches nearly vertical when young).  Thin leaves are rounded at base, broadly elliptic with sharp point at tip (up to 17 mm long x 9 cm wide), and small teeth along entire leaf margin. Main veins on leaf are obvious and both surfaces are hairless.  Leaf stalk 12-20 mm long.  Bell-shaped flowers are magenta or pink to deep red, hang in clusters of 1-5 (July to September) and are followed by glossy scarlet cherries (<12 x 10 mm).

Water Poppy,Hydrocleys nymphoides,"A perennial waterlily-like plant with thick, shiny, oval, bright green leaves (7 cm long) that float on the water surface and have an inflated main vein on the underside. Leaves and roots grow in clusters from nodes along the stems, which float just below the water surface. A distinctive poppy-like, three-petalled yellow flower with a purple centre (to 8 cm across) is produced from November to April.","Spreads by plantlets or stem fragments carried by water, boats, fishing gear or machinery. No seed is produced in New Zealand.",
Yellow Flag Iris ,Iris pseudacorus,"Many Gladiolus and related species are similar, and there are four other exotic Iris species that appear in the wild. Iris pseudacorus is the only aquatic species that grows in clumps and has tall stems and yellow flowers. ","Rhizome mats displace native plants, especially vulnerable species that live on the margins of waterbodies. It can cause flooding and changes in the water levels in swamps. Poisonous seeds may have an impact on birdlife. ",
